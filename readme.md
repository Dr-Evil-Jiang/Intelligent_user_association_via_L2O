1. DQN: ``train_dqn`` finished with saving and loading operations;
2. Plot: ``plot_res``: beautify the figures and master the seaborn packet:
3. Res: simulation results, for ``num_BD=3`` and ``num_BD=10``, respectively;
4. unsupervised learning try some more effective tricks.
5. Issue: ``next(iter(Dataset))`` will always give the first batch.

1. Plot: DQN training loss, unsupervised learning loss, and supervised learning loss
2. Performance: DQN vs Unsupervised learning vs supervised learning;
3. Make the figures beautiful.
